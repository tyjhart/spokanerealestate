# Spokane, WA Real Estate

This project is dedicated to analysis of the real estate market in my hometown of Spokane, WA. I'm working on both statistical analysis and visualization of data showing how and where people live. Also included is development of machine learning models predicting home prices, rent, etc.

## Data Sources

Most data is sourced directly from Spokane County. We're fortunate that the county has [an ArcGIS site with downloadable data](https://gisdatacatalog-spokanecounty.opendata.arcgis.com/). The following data is readily available, and mostly in a usable state for analysis:

1. [Parcel information](https://gisdatacatalog-spokanecounty.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/parcels-1)
1. [Recent home sales](https://gisdatacatalog-spokanecounty.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/property-sales-2019)
1. Past annual home sales ([2018](https://gisdatacatalog-spokanecounty.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/property-sales-2018), [2017](https://gisdatacatalog-spokanecounty.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/property-sales-2017), [2016](https://gisdatacatalog-spokanecounty.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/property-sales-2016), etc.)
1. [Assessment ($) data](https://www.spokanecounty.org/4123/Property-Information-Downloads)
